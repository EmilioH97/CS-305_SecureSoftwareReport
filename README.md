Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Finacial is a company that provides different options like investing and insurance to their customers. They are wating to create a more current system that is secure that 
provides verification in the form of a checksum.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I searched and added SHA-256 which met their requirements of a secure network with their specifications. I also ran different software checks that ensured the security of the software to prevent
the potential loss of customer's private information.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found it challanging to create things like dependacy reports that required different steps that both lead to verification of security.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I added different forms of securty and I would continue to use these tools to get a better understanding on possibly vulnerabilities that I could prevent.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I continued to rerun the code into the vulnurability checks and when issues were present I adjusted the code based on this information until the vulnerabilities were
minimized.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used section testing that helped me to divide the work that needed to be completed and only move on when each step was completed then test as a whole.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show how I was able to use vulnurability check systems to create a more secure system.
